# Quizzical

## Overview

The Quizzical project was created to offer users an interactive and educational quiz experience across a diverse array of topics. Its primary objectives are:

- _Knowledge Assessment_: Quizzical empowers users to assess their knowledge by selecting quizzes based on their chosen difficulty level and topic of interest.

- _Immediate Feedback_: After completing a quiz, users receive immediate feedback on their performance, highlighting correct and incorrect answers for the current session.

- _Engaging Learning_: Quizzical encourages continuous learning and engagement by allowing users to restart quizzes with different topics or the same subject. Users can also choose their desired difficulty level for each quiz session.
